#The PA DSS Requirements - Vietnamese Version#

__By Levis Nickaster__

##Purpose##

Originally from my business needs, So I'm trying to translate The PA DSS Requirements to Vietnamese, and maybe the PCI DSS also, in the future.

NOTE: This is a draft version, not the final. So it only contains the translated requirements set of whole the Official document, but not the Procedures and also Appendix. Will add them later.

Based on PA DSS v3.2 (the latest version at current time). 
See the pa_DSS_VI.md file.

##How can you help?##

Yes, because it's an in-house project, and i'm currently working alone, so it contains bugs. Please give your support if you're interested, by providing suggesstions, corrections, or co-operate in translating the missing parts, which are not translated, though. That would be highly appreciated.

Note that the document is being written in Markdown.
